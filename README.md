# Cuda Demoscene
---
## Precondition
It's been test on Cuda10 and Visual Studio 2015.

## Introudction
It's a course project that made with a lot of Cuda. In this project, teaching assistant proviced a converter to y4m video format. Thererfore, I made the demoscene by myself. Parallelizing thing is Cuda's advantage. (e.g. rainning drop, numbers, reflection of rainning drop) In this method, things will be done faster.
